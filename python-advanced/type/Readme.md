# Type 

- A type is one of the most fundamental and abstract terms of Python, it is the foremost type that any class can be inherited from.
- If you’re looking for the type of **class**, then `type` is returned.
- Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
- Information about an object’s class is contained in `__class__`.
