# Conditions 
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

        Equals: a == b
        Not Equals: a != b
        Less than: a < b
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
        Greater than: a > b
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b
