# Conditional Statements in python 

1. if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
```

2. elif statement: Stands for "else if" and allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially after an initial if statement.

```python
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is true
```

3. else statement: Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.

```python
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is true
else:
    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
```
