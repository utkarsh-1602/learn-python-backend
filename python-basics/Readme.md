# Python Basic Concepts you should know 

- Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

- Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.

- Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

- In python, Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)
