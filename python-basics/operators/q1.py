# Arithmatic Operators 

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print(number)


remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)

# Power relationship
squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)

# concatenate strings
helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)


# multiplying strings 
lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
print(lotsofhellos)

# Using Operators with Lists
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)


# multiplying list with multiplication operator 
print([1,2,3] * 3)
