# Basic Operators 

1. Arithmetic Operators
- Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.
- Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
- Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator.
- Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence.
- Lists can be joined with the addition operators.
- Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:



2. Floor Division 
- A // (double slash) sign is an integer division operator where the results are always rounded.

3. Equal to Operator (==)

- [Refer q2.py](q2.py)

```python
var = 1
print(var == 0)

```

4. Not equal to operator (!=)
```python
var = 1
print(var != 0)

```

5. Comparison Operators
 
Python supports the usual logical Logical from mathematics. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

        Equals: a == b
        Not Equals: a != b
        Less than: a < b
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
        Greater than: a > b
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b
